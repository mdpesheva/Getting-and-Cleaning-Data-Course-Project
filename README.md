This repository is Milena Pesheva's submission for the "Getting and
Cleaning Data" course project. It contains instructions on how to run
analysis on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset.

Dataset:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files:

1.  CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the data, variables and any
    transformations or work that was performed on the data

2.  run_analysis.R - performs the data preparation following the
    provided instructions in the course projectâ€™s definition:

-   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

-   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.

-   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set

-   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.
